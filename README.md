# Kinvey TiKinveyGeoExample

This is a Appcelerator Titanium sample app integrated with Kinvey, to use make an account on
https://console.kinvey.com

For more details, see the blog post at http://goo.gl/9dyMm.


Also, you have to update `app-key` and `app-secret` in the file `app.js`
to your app-key and app-secret from the Kinvey console.


This example shows how to use a Foursquare Data Provider, the example is a work in progress 
and I will continue to update this project.

Please note that I am currently working through some issues with the kinvey appcelerator javascript module, I have 
sent the issues to kinvey support, but the verions included in this project has the fixes in it.
